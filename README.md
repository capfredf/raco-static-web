# raco-static-web

A little raco command to serve some files on the web.  Inspired by the command
line mode of the python [http.server module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html).

## Usage

1. Ensure `raco` is in your `$PATH`.
2. Open terminal in folder you want to serve.
  - Alternatively use the `-d` command line option to specify a directory.
3. Run `raco static-web` to serve the current folder.

For help and options use `raco help static-web`.
